## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Send feedback from anywhere.** A "Feedback" button in the header opens a modal
  with a single text box; submitting stores the message tagged with who sent it,
  when, and which page they were on, then confirms with a toast.
- **Review feedback in Admin.** A read-only "Feedback" tab in the Admin console
  lists submissions newest-first (user, message, page, time), visible to admins only.

### Changed
- New required setting `MONGODB_FEEDBACK_COLLECTION` plus a pre-created Cosmos
  `feedback` collection are needed before deploy. Local dev (docker `mongo:7`)
  auto-creates the collection on first write, so only the env var is needed locally.
